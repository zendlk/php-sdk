# PHP SDK ( Zend )

In a few lines of code, your PHP application can send, receive, and reply to text messages with Zend programmable messages.

### Installation

You can install our PHP SDK into your application by following methods. But we recommend using the composer package to unlock the full potential of our SDK.

#### Composer

You just need to run the following command in your terminal to install Zend PHP SDK into your application.

```
composer require zendlk/php-sdk
```

Once you install the composer package you can call the composer autoloader in PHP files to load Zend SDK into your application.

```php
<?php
require "vendor\autoload.php";
?>
```

#### Manual

You can also use our PHP SDK by manually installing it in your application. This method is not recommended by Zend.
